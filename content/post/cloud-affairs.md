“The Cloud” took the web by storm, and the hype is reaching “XML is gonna solve all world problems” 1999 levels. But every software developer in his right mind should have some precautions if someone claims that “the Cloud” will change everything. True that that rule should be applied to all new technologies or trends you come across, but we're talking Cloud here, IT'S EVERYWHERE. God help us all! Oh wait he basically started this.

The main reason I’m writing this it that I think I can give a more realistic and clear view and maybe even a alternative look on the various aspects you have to deal with if you’re building an application running “in the Cloud”. Ironically as with real clouds the virtual one tend to be a bit foggy.

First things first. The meaning of “the Cloud” can vary a lot. And in order to be able to speak about “the Cloud” without those silly quotes, I should first explain what **I** mean with “the Cloud”. Off course we all know that “the Cloud” was nothing more than the symbol that’s being used to represent the Internet.

So for this blog post I’ll use the following definition:

## The “new” Microsoft
As you should be able to read on the [http://blog.saberkarmous.nl/about][about page] I’m a .NET developer/architect. So it’s obvious to me that I look at Microsoft first to see what they have to offer when it comes to cloud offerings. To be honest, two years ago I really thought they were doing a lousy job. But the current state that Azure is in really competes with the likes of Amazon, Google, etc. And the ease of use when developing with Visual Studio is hard to beat.

But one of the coolest things to me is that Microsoft is not taking a hostile stance regarding “foreign technology”. So eg. you can run Ubuntu, Oracle (Java), node.js, on top of Azure. If you told me this in 2001 I wouldn’t even AFK to listen to you.

I think it makes perfect sense to me, now. since all the tools are available in the cloud these days, Windows and Office are less and less important. Especially not for the cool kids that are graduating right now. They just need anything that runs a web brower so they can use their stuff stored in the cloud. And average Joe doesn’t need all the bells and whistles that Word/Excel/Powerpoint has to offer.

So with Azure Microsoft goes all “meta” on everyone. Instead of fighting on the OS/Office level, they embrace the competition and make it run on Azure. This way Microsoft makes money of anything, as long as it’s running on Azure. So instead of selling as much Windows as possible, they try to sell as “much Azure” as possible. Call it “Azure Anything” (yeah I know they should hire me as the new CEO, and -bring sexy back- make Microsoft hacker walhalla).

BUT! What I find strange is I cannot see what the specs of the CPU’s of the Azure instances are. And that’s a bit strange to me. We’re being advised by Microsoft on how to provision for our applications running on Azure. If the performance is not good enough you either pick bigger instances, or use more instances. 

In all honesty,  neither does Amazon offer detailed specs about their CPU’s. Hier moet nog een link komen naar Amazon specs


## Complexity
- Testing
- Deployment
- Performance measurement
- Failover, the database might not be there. Handle it!
- Privacy
- Security
- Pricing
- Integration
- New technology needs evangelism 




## Privacy
A very big and valid concern these days has to do with privacy. I think there’s a large group of people that’s starting to distrust … , and maybe even all technology. And there’s a, in my eyes alarming, large group of people that do not really care about their privacy on the web. The latter can be recognised by there mantra : “They may know anything about me, cause I have nothing to hide”.

I have quite a dilemma. I really love technology, but am scared shitless by the new ways that data is used to profile ones behaviour. It’s a bit as if were living in Minority Report, and the three Pre-Cogs (read: foreseeing people) have been replaced by surprisingly accurate computer algorithms.

But I also catch myself “giving up”, because of the fact that the “data” is already out there. Going of the grid is not a realistic option for me anymore

## Speed
How fast is the cloud actually?
